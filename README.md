# Green_Stocks

## Overview of Project
 This project's goal was to use VBA to build a macro to analyze alternative energy in an error-free and automated way.  
 This program will enable Steve's parents to gain more in-depth insight into their DQ investment and analyze the stock's 
 price performance and total trading volume vs. peers.  Finally, this program can be used in the future to analyze other stocks and sectors.


## Results

As the two graphics highlight, the alternative energy sector performed demonstrably better in 2017 than in 2018, with 
11 of the 12 stocks generated a positive return in 2017 vs. only two in 2018.  DQ was the top-performing stock of the 
peer group in 2017, causing a 199.4% positive return, but the worse performing stock in 2018, generating a 62.6% loss.



##Analysis of Execution Times

The original script had execution times of 0.5546875 seconds and 0.546875 seconds for 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
The refactored scription had execution times of 0.109375 seconds and 0.109375 seconds for 2017 and 2018, respectively.  
Screenshots follow.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Although it's much more accurate to use VBA, the length of the code made it hard to keep track of the codes and had
to be redone multiple times to get the proper results
